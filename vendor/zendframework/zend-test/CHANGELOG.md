### Fixed

- [#33](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/pull/33) fixes
  `queryContentRegexAssertion()` (used by `assertQueryContentRegex()` and
  `assertXpathQueryContentRegex()`) properly checks all matching nodes for
  content matching the regular expression, instead of only the first. The
  prevents false negative assertions from occuring.
- [#21](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/pull/21) updates the
  `sebastian/version` dependency to also allow v2.0 releases.
- [#31](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-test/pull/31) fixes an issue with
  the `AbstractControllerTestCase` when used to test a console request.
  Previously, routes with multiple literal flags were never matched; they now
  are.
